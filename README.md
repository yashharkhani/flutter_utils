your_flutter_project/
└── .cursor/
    └── rules/
        └── flutter_rules.mdc
```

The rules will be automatically applied by Cursor when you work in this project, helping maintain consistent code quality and following Flutter best practices.

### Using Code Generation

Generate freezed boilerplate code with guided prompts. All generated code is automatically copied to clipboard and displayed in the output panel.

#### Generate Freezed Cubit/Bloc State

1. Click **Generate Freezed Cubit/Bloc State** in the Code Generation section
2. Enter the state class name (e.g., `AuthState`)
3. Enter the UI state class name (e.g., `AuthUiState`)
4. Specify the number of fields for the UI state (1-20)
5. For each field:
   - Enter field name (e.g., `isLoading`)
   - Select field type from dropdown
   - Default values are automatically assigned
6. Generated code includes **all 3 classes in one complete file**:
   - Main state class with `APIState` and UI state fields
   - Complete `APIState` class (initial/loading/loaded/error)
   - Complete UI state class with your custom fields
   - All initial factory constructors

Example output (complete file):
```dart
@freezed
abstract class AuthState with _$AuthState {
  const factory AuthState({
    required APIState apiState,
    required AuthUiState uiState,
  }) = _AuthState;

  factory AuthState.initial() => AuthState(
        apiState: const APIState.initial(),
        uiState: AuthUiState.initial(),
      );
}

@freezed
abstract class APIState with _$APIState {
  const factory APIState.initial() = _APIStateInitial;

  const factory APIState.loading() = _APIStateLoading;

  const factory APIState.loaded({
    required dynamic data,
  }) = _APIStateLoaded;

  const factory APIState.error({
    int? code,
    String? message,
    String? status,
  }) = _APIStateError;
}

@freezed
abstract class AuthUiState with _$AuthUiState {
  const factory AuthUiState({
    required bool isLoading,
    required String errorMessage,
    required int loginAttempts,
    required User? currentUser,
  }) = _AuthUiState;

  factory AuthUiState.initial() => const AuthUiState(
        isLoading: false,
        errorMessage: '',
        loginAttempts: 0,
        currentUser: null,
      );
}
```

#### Generate Freezed API State

1. Click **Generate Freezed API State** in the Code Generation section
2. Choose whether to use a generic type `<T>` or not
3. Generated code includes:
   - Initial state
   - Loading state
   - Loaded state (with data)
   - Error state (with code, message, status)

Example output (with generic):
```dart
@freezed
abstract class APIState<T> with _$APIState<T> {
  const factory APIState.initial() = _APIStateInitial<T>;
  const factory APIState.loading() = _APIStateLoading<T>;
  const factory APIState.loaded({
    required T data,
  }) = _APIStateLoaded<T>;
  const factory APIState.error({
    int? code,
    String? message,
    String? status,
  }) = _APIStateError<T>;
}
```

#### Generate Freezed UI State

1. Click **Generate Freezed UI State** in the Code Generation section
2. Enter the UI state class name (e.g., `AuthUiState`)
3. Specify the number of fields (1-20)
4. For each field:
   - Enter field name (e.g., `isLoading`)
   - Select field type from dropdown:
     - `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`
     - `List`, `Map`, `dynamic`
     - Custom (nullable) - prompts for custom type
   - Default values are automatically assigned based on type
5. Generated code includes:
   - Field declarations
   - Initial factory constructor with default values

Example output:
```dart
@freezed
abstract class AuthUiState with _$AuthUiState {
  const factory AuthUiState({
    required bool isLoading,
    required String errorMessage,
    required int loginAttempts,
    required User? currentUser,
  }) = _AuthUiState;

  factory AuthUiState.initial() => const AuthUiState(
        isLoading: false,
        errorMessage: '',
        loginAttempts: 0,
        currentUser: null,
      );
}
```

#### Generate Freezed Model

1. Click **Generate Freezed Model** in the Code Generation section
2. Enter the model class name (e.g., `User`)
3. Choose whether to include JSON serialization (fromJson/toJson)
4. Specify the number of fields (1-20)
5. For each field:
   - Enter field name (e.g., `userId`)
   - Select field type from dropdown:
     - `int`, `int?`, `double`, `double?`
     - `String`, `String?`, `bool`, `bool?`
     - `List<dynamic>`, `Map<String, dynamic>`
     - Custom - prompts for custom type
   - If JSON serialization is enabled, optionally specify JSON key (if different from field name)
6. Generated code includes:
   - Field declarations with `@JsonKey` annotations (if needed)
   - Optional fromJson factory method

Example output (with JSON serialization):
```dart
@freezed
abstract class User with _$User {
  const factory User({
    @JsonKey(name: 'user_id') required String userId,
    required String name,
    required String? email,
    required int age,
  }) = _User;

  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
}
```

**Note**: For models with JSON serialization, remember to add:
```dart
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';

part 'user.freezed.dart';
part 'user.g.dart';
```

#### Git Actions

All git actions work with your current workspace git repository:

1. **Open Repository**
   - Opens GitHub repository in your default browser
   - If on a feature branch, opens that branch view
   - If on main/master, opens repository homepage

2. **Open Current File**
   - Opens the currently active file on GitHub
   - Automatically jumps to your current cursor line
   - Uses current branch (not commit) for live file view
   - Perfect for sharing specific code with teammates
   - Example: `https://github.com/user/repo/blob/feature-branch/lib/main.dart#L45`

3. **View Current Commit**
   - Opens the current HEAD commit on GitHub
   - See commit message, changed files, and diff
   - Shows short hash (first 7 chars) in notification

4. **Copy Commit Hash**
   - Copies the full commit SHA to clipboard
   - Shows short hash in confirmation message
   - Useful for referencing commits in PRs/issues

5. **Create PR**
   - Opens GitHub PR creation page
   - Pre-configured to create PR: `current branch` → `master`
   - Works with any branch except main/master

6. **View PR**
   - Opens GitHub PRs filtered by current branch
   - See all PRs for your current branch
   - Quick way to check PR status

7. **Open Actions**
   - Opens GitHub Actions page

### Build Process

Each build follows this optimized sequence:

1. **Optional**: Delete `pubspec.lock` (if selected)
2. **1st Pass**: Clean project + Get dependencies
3. **2nd Pass**: Clean project + Get dependencies
4. **1st Build**: Execute build command
5. **3rd Pass**: Clean project + Get dependencies
6. **Final Build**: Execute build command

This multiple-pass approach ensures:
- Fresh dependency resolution
- Consistent build artifacts
- Reduced build issues from cached state

## Configuration

### Settings

Configure the extension in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "flutterBuildUtils.flutterCommand": "fvm flutter",  // or "flutter"
  "flutterBuildUtils.customFlutterCommand": ""        // custom command prefix
}
```

### Available Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `flutterBuildUtils.flutterCommand` | Flutter command prefix | `fvm flutter` |
| `flutterBuildUtils.customFlutterCommand` | Custom Flutter command (overrides above) | `""` |

### Customizing Build Commands

Build command sequences are defined in `src/buildCommands.ts`. To customize:
