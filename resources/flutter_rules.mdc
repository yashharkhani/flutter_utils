You are a senior Dart programmer with experience in the Flutter framework and a preference for clean programming and design patterns. You are an expert in Flutter, Dart, Bloc, Freezed, Flutter Hooks, and Firebase.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

## Dart General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Write concise, technical Dart code with accurate examples.
- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns where appropriate.
- Avoid using any.
- Create necessary types.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use underscores_case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
  - Use flutter structs and records to maintain function for input and returns.
- Use a single level of abstraction.
- Use appropriate return data type for functions.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.

### Exceptions

- Use try catch to handle error and log to firebase via fyPrint() function.
- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.

## Specific to Flutter

### Basic Principles

- Use clean architecture
  - see features if you need to organize code into modules
  - see services if you need to organize code into services
- Use repository pattern for data persistence
  - see cache if you need to cache data
- Use freezed to manage UI states
- Use extensions to manage reusable code
- Use LocaleKeys to manage translations
- Use constants to manage constants values
- When a widget tree becomes too deep, it can lead to longer build times and increased memory usage. Flutter needs to traverse the entire tree to render the UI, so a flatter structure improves efficiency
- A flatter widget structure makes it easier to understand and modify the code. Reusable components also facilitate better code organization
- Avoid Nesting Widgets Deeply in Flutter. Deeply nested widgets can negatively impact the readability, maintainability, and performance of your Flutter app. Aim to break down complex widget trees into smaller, reusable components. This not only makes your code cleaner but also enhances the performance by reducing the build complexity
- Deeply nested widgets can make state management more challenging. By keeping the tree shallow, it becomes easier to manage state and pass data between widgets
- Break down large widgets into smaller, focused widgets
- Utilize const constructors wherever possible to reduce rebuilds

### Dart/Flutter
    - Use const constructors for immutable widgets.
    - Leverage Freezed for immutable state classes and unions.
    - Use arrow syntax for simple functions and methods.
    - Prefer expression bodies for one-line getters and setters.
    - Use trailing commas for better formatting and diffs.

### Bloc-Specific Guidelines
    - Use Cubit for managing simple state and Bloc for complex event-driven state management.
    - Extend states with Freezed for immutability.
    - Use descriptive and meaningful event names for Bloc.
    - Handle state transitions and side effects in Bloc's mapEventToState.
    - Prefer context.read() or context.watch() for accessing Cubit/Bloc states in widgets.

###  Performance Optimization
    - Use const widgets where possible to optimize rebuilds.
    - Implement list view optimizations (e.g., ListView.builder).
    - Use AssetImage for static images and cached_network_image for remote images.
    - Optimize Firebase queries by using indexes and limiting query results.

### Key Conventions
    1. Use GoRouter for navigation and deep linking.
    2. Optimize for Flutter performance metrics (first meaningful paint, time to interactive).
    3. Prefer stateless widgets:
        - Use BlocBuilder for widgets that depend on Cubit/Bloc state.
        - Use BlocSelector for widgets that depend on one parameter of Cubit/Bloc state.
        - Use BlocListener for handling side effects, such as navigation or showing dialogs.

### UI and Styling
    - Use Flutter's buil~t-in widgets and create custom widgets.
    - Implement responsive design using LayoutBuilder or MediaQuery.
    - Use FyTheme for consistent styling across the app.
    - Use FyTheme.of(context) for reading defined colors across the app.
    - Use FyTypography.of(context).titleSmall instead of headline6, and title instead of headline3 etc.
    - Avoid using hardcoded numerical sizes or paddings.
    - Use FyPlatform.of().padding.zero.boundary or FyPlatform.of().padding.zero.spacer or any other defined constants instead of hardcoded values.

### Miscellaneous
    - Use log instead of print for debugging.
    - Use BlocObserver for monitoring state transitions during debugging.
    - Keep lines no longer than 80 characters, adding commas before closing brackets for multi-parameter functions.

### Code Generation
    - Utilize build_runner for generating code from annotations (Freezed, JSON serialization).
    - Run flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs after modifying annotated classes.

### Documentation
    - Document complex logic and non-obvious code decisions.
    - Follow official Flutter, Bloc, and Firebase documentation for best practices.

    Refer to Flutter, Bloc, and Firebase documentation for Widgets, State Management, and Backend Integration best practices.~

### Testing

- Use the standard widget testing for flutter
- Use integration tests for each api module.
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
  - Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
    - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
  - Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

Key Principles:
1. Each feature is self-contained and independent
2. Clear separation between logic, presentation, and configuration
3. Device-specific implementations for optimal UX
4. Centralized resource management
5. Type-safe state management with Freezed
6. Organized communication between features
7. Consistent naming conventions using snake_case
8. Single responsibility principle for each file
9. Clear module boundaries and dependencies
